| [Lexical Analysis â€“ LAC](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/hubdetail?name=lac&en_category=LexicalAnalysis) | Baidu's self-developed lexical analysis model. It is able to complete the tasks of Chinese word segmentation, lexical labeling and proper name recognition roughly. It is evaluated on Baidu's own dataset. LAC effect: Precision=88.0%, Recall=88.7%, F1-Score=88.4%. |
| [Word Segmentation Network - jieba](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/hubdetail?name=jieba_paddle&en_category=LexicalAnalysis) | This module is a word segmentation network (bi-directional GRU) built by jieba using the PaddlePaddle deep learning framework. It also supports the traditional word segmentation methods of jieba, such as exact mode, full mode, search engine mode and other word segmentation modes. |
