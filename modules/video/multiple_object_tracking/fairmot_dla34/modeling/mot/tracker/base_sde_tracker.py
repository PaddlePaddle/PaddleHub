    A single target track with state space `(x, y, a, h)` and associated
    velocities, where `(x, y)` is the center of the bounding box, `a` is the
    aspect ratio and `h` is the height.

    Args:
        mean (ndarray): Mean vector of the initial state distribution.

            originates from. If not None, this feature is added to the `features` cache.

            update.
        state (TrackState): The current track state.
        features (List[ndarray]): A cache of features. On each measurement update,
