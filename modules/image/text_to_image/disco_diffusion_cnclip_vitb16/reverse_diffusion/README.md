# Diffusion model (Paddle)
This module implements diffusion model which accepts a text prompt and outputs images semantically close to the text. The code is rewritten by Paddle, and mainly refer to two projects:  jina-ai/discoart[https://github.com/jina-ai/discoart] and openai/guided-diffusion[https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion]. Thanks for their wonderful work.
