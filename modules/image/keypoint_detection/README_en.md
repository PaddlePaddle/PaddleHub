#### Key Point Detection

Pose Estimation refers to the detection of key points in the human body, such as joints, facial features, and so on. It describes information about the human skeleton through these key points. Pose estimation is essential for describing human posture and predicting human behaviors. It is the basis for many computer vision tasks, such as motion classification, abnormal behavior detection, and automated driving.
