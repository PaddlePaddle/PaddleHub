### Image Segmentation

Image semantic segmentation, as the name implies, is the grouping/segmentation of image pixels according to the semantic meanings. Image semantics refers to the understanding of the image content, for example, depict what is done in which place by which object. Segmentation refers to the labeling of each pixel in an image as to which category it belongs. In recent years, it has been used to segment street scenes to avoid pedestrians and vehicles in unmanned vehicle driving technology, and to assist in diagnosis in medical image analysis.
