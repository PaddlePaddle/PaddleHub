| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Face Detection](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/hubdetail?name=pyramidbox_lite_server&en_category=FaceDetection) | Baidu self-developed model. It is the WIDER Face dataset ►Champion Model◄ in March 2018. |
| [Ultra Lightweight Face Detection](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/hubdetail?name=ultra_light_fast_generic_face_detector_1mb_640&en_category=FaceDetection) | Real-time ultra-lightweight general-purpose face detection model designed for edge computing devices or low computational power devices (e.g., ARM inference). It can perform real-time face detection inference in general-purpose scenarios in low computational power devices, such as ARM. |
| [Mask face detection and recognition.](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/hubdetail?name=pyramidbox_lite_server_mask&en_category=FaceDetection) | It is the First open source mask face detection and recognition model in the industry, with attracting widespread attention. |
