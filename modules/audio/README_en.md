| [Text-to-speech transformer\_tts\_ljspeech](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/hubdetail?name=transformer_tts_ljspeech&en_category=TextToSpeech) | TansformerTTS is a fusion of Transformer and Tacotron2 with satisfactory results. It is an English TTS model and supports the prediction only. |
| [Text-to-speech fastspeech\_ljspeech](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/hubdetail?name=fastspeech_ljspeech&en_category=TextToSpeech) | FastSpeech is based on the attention diagonal line extracted from the teacher model in the encoder-decoder structure to make pronunciation duration prediction. It is an English TTS model and supports the prediction only. |
| [Text-to-speech deepvoice3\_ljspeech](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/hubdetail?name=deepvoice3_ljspeech&en_category=TextToSpeech) | Deep Voice 3 is an end-to-end TTS model released by Baidu Research Institute in 2017 (paper accepted in ICLR 2018). It is a seq2seq model based on the convolutional neural network and attention mechanism. It is an English TTS model and supports the prediction only. |
